Due to oddities with Mac's file system, there's a chance you may be told the game is "damaged", and cannot be run. 

== TECHNIQUE #1 == 
In order to make the game runnable on your computer... 
1) Launch the terminal application. 
2) type the following command "chmod -R +x" 
3) Drag the .app file from your finder window into your terminal window. It should now read "chmod -R +x <path to app file>" 
4) Press enter and hopefully the command works! RIGHT CLICK the app and select "open" to run the game. 

== TECHNIQUE #2 == 
If technique #1 doesn't work, please use command "xattr -r -d com.apple.quarantine path/to/game.app" in step 4 instead. 

== TECHNIQUE #3 ==
After originally downloading the .app file...
1) Move the file out of your downloads folder onto your desktop
2) Right click the .app file and select "open". If this does not work, right click and select "open" again
3) A prompt reading "Mac" can't be opened because... appears. Select "open" from this prompt to run the game.
