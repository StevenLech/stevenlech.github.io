<h3>My Contributions:</h3>
<body>
    I worked on every enemy provided (minus goriya/boomerang enemy), authentic level design and progression, and helped design the new and unique custom level.
    I worked on room enemy spawns and freezes, locked doors, and completed room rewards such as spawning a key or freeing link from being trapped in a room

<h4>Technology Used:</h4>
<body>
    The core implementation of this remake was through the Unity Game Engine. Unity provides features and mechanics for game design in a more intuitive way. 
    Unity has an integrated drag and drop feature used to help build components on game objects, leading to the final results seen above. 
    The background of Unity comes from the programming language of C#, which complements the Unity engine well. Since C# is an object-oriented programming language,
    it is easily used to implement classes and inheritence used to build game objects that Unity can display with unique features.
